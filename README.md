Node-RED Dashboard: Data from the MediBox, including temperature and humidity readings, are transmitted to the Node-RED dashboard via the MQTT protocol. Users can visualize this data in real-time and make adjustments to the light conditions within the MediBox as needed through the dashboard interface.
